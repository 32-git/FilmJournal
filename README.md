# Introduction

Simply put, FilmJournal is a movie app. It is a movie app built the way I'd like to have one.

With this, you can browse media, favourite them and also save them to your watchlist.

Your favourite media, as well as those in your watchlist, are divided into being either a movie or a series.

Another feature is that you can custom sort your favourites/watchlist as you wish via drag & drop. This could be based on the movies you like the most, or the ones you want to watch the earliest.


# What You Need To Get Started

**TMDb API Key:** Get one for free at the TMDb website, and enter it in...
